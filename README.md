# AuroraLedger

AuroraLedger is a solo-curated utility that keeps track of my random creative experiments and glances into both the Web2 and Web3 sides of my tinkering. I treat it like a reflective lab notebook that lets me sketch, log, and revisit spur-of-the-moment ideas while keeping the experience tactile and human.

## Why AuroraLedger
- A mirror for the odd, cross-disciplinary mini-projects that spark at strange hours.
- A place to record Web2 tools, tiny scripts, and Web3 riffs without the pressure of full-scale delivery.
- A quick CLI-style prompt to remind me what I was chasing and why.

## Pillars
1. **Idea Harvest** - capture the twist I just had, tag it, and keep a timestamped ledger entry.
2. **Artifact Shelves** - categorize those entries as tools, scripts, bots, trading plays, or visual pieces.
3. **Prompt Whisperer** - a little assistant that takes the current ledger line and makes it a mini brief for a future session.

## Roadmap
1. Start with a README + project sketch (this current doc).
2. Build a small Python CLI that records entries, labels them, and recycles them into prompts.
3. Add a JSON-backed datastore with schema hints and an export helper.
4. Expand with a visual status board (beyond the first phase) and log aggregator.

## How to wander
The project is intentionally light on dependencies. I planing to keep everything in plain Python, add a few helper modules, and steadily push commits that document each tiny leap.

## Sample ledger entry
There is a small example in `examples/ledger-sample.json` that shows how an entry is recorded after running the CLI once.
